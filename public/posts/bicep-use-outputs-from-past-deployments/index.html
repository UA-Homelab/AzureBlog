I am hoping this will, at some point, help someone in the same situation.\nWhy is this usefull? You can reference all outputs from your past deployments by only knowing the deployment and output name.\nIn my role, I regularly deploy landing zones for a variety of customers, each with their own unique requirements. To streamline this process, I’ve developed templates for key areas like connectivity, management, identity and governance (management groups, policies and rbac). Some of the platform resources provisioned are later referenced in policies or other platform components. Example: A policy to send logs to a log analytics workspace in the management subscription will need the workspace as a parameter.\nTo maximize flexibility—especially since different customer teams often handle different parts of the landing zone—I maintain separate templates for each platform area, as well as for the governance elements. However, this approach introduces a challenge: resource names and configurations can vary from customer to customer, which would normally mean updating parameters across every template and increase human errors.\nBy leveraging outputs from previous deployments, I can keep each deployment fully independent, while only needing to adjust parameters for the templates that actually create those resources. This not only simplifies the process but also makes it much easier to manage variations between customers without sacrificing modularity or maintainability.\nHow to use past deployment outputs After some frustrating time searching for a solution, I was thinking that probably the deployments (that you can see on subscripions and resource groups) are probably also just ARM-Resources and should be able to be defined as existing resources in templates. It turns out, this was the solution!\nYou can basically just add any deployment as an existing resource to your bicep file and then access all output values, that have been defined. So you have to start with\nvar deploymentName = '' resource deployment 'Microsoft.Resources/deployments@2025-04-01' existing = { name: deploymentName } ",
